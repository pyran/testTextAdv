testTextAdv

A small text adventure game created in python3. I might use it for a larger
game in the future.  I used Nicholas M's tutorial as guide and added my own
additions. http://www.bluzeandmuse.com/final_site/how_to.html

The game is complete. Although it could use a few optional features:
-Dying
-Save and restore
-NPCs and speech trees
